  <h1>Welcome to Ryan Thornton's Website (under construction)</h1>
	<section>
  <p>Hi, I'm Ryan Thornton, a third year Computer Science and Physics
  student at the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm interested
  in computer architecture, computer design, and quantum computing.</p>
  <p><a href="/resources/resume.pdf">This is my resume.</a> In addition
  to the listed professional and volunteer expirience, my coursework at 
  Cal has involved many projects.  The following projects are highlights of
  my Berkeley expirience.  I can provide my code for review upon request
  for the majority of the following projects; the project specifications
  are linked.</p>
